# Deep-neural-networks(CNN)-Clustering-Dimensionality reduction techniques


Rock dataset can be found here: https://osf.io/d6b9y/ 
The aim is to work on two classification datasets (rocks and chest xrays) and check if clustering, dimensionality reduction techniques and applying deep neural network to the two datasets improves the accuracy or not.
